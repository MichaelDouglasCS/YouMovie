## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

```
1 - Xcode 11+
2 - Swift 5+
3 - Cocoapods
4 - Homebrew
5 - SwiftLint
```

### Installing

Firs of all, you need install the Xcode 11+, you can find it in the App Store.

```
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

After you must install the CocoaPods.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Lastly you need open the Terminal, go to Project root folder, and run this command:

```
$ pod install
```

After that, you need to install the Homebrew, you can find the steps on this link below.

```
https://brew.sh/index_pt-br
```

With Homebrew installed, you need to install the SwiftLint to assure your code linting, to do that just execute the command below.

```
$ brew install swiftlint
```

Now you have all elements to run this project
