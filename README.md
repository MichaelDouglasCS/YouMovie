# YouMovie
This application is a Technical Test to CI&T that has as goal implement a list of movies. The app should show 3 sections, such as Popular, Top Rated and Upcoming and be able to navigate to the details of each item.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

```
1 - Xcode 11+
2 - Swift 5+
3 - Pods
```

### Installing

Firs of all, you need install the Xcode 11+, you can find it in the App Store.

```
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

After you must install the CocoaPods.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Lastly you need open the Terminal, go to Project root folder, and run this code:

```
$ pod install
```

Now you have all elements to run this project
